a tool to make note taking easy and refreshing.
i love to journal by i don't love everything that gets in the way of me writing on a daily basis. i want to have one consistent medium that will allow me to express my thoughts and save them in a clear way. i have a ton of notes that are rotting away somewhere in a text file on the very computer i am writing this with. but i am not accessing this information and learning from the lessons i've found.

so, i hope to create something that will cleanly and easily help me gather my mind.
